  Several Bible verses highlight Jesus' love for children, emphasizing his welcoming of them and teaching of their
   importance in the kingdom of God. Matthew 19:14 states, "But Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, 
   and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" Mark 10:14 echoes this, 
   and Luke 18:16 also emphasizes Jesus' love for children. Additionally, Proverbs 17:6 mentions, 
  "Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children."
